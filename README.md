## :trophy: Take Away
- GameMaker understands animated GIFs, in Godot these have to be converted to image sequences.
- Y-sorting can be automated in Godot.
- User interface in Godot is classic editor with properties pane, in GameMaker editor windowas are laid out on an endless canvas which is more difficult to navigate.
- GameMaker is easier to start with but Godot offers more posibilities with extra layers of complexity.
